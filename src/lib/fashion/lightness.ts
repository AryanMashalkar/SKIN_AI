// Lightness remapping for garment recolouring (pure, unit-tested).
//
// A hue/saturation swap alone keeps the photo's lightness, so a khaki jacket
// "recoloured" to navy comes out powder blue. Instead each pixel's lightness is
// remapped so the garment's average lands on the target colour's lightness,
// while folds and highlights keep their relative depth:
//
//   darkening  -> scale toward black:  l' = l * (target / mean)
//   lightening -> scale toward white:  l' = 1 - (1 - l) * ((1 - target) / (1 - mean))
//
// Scaling (rather than adding a constant offset) is what stops shadows from
// clipping to flat black on a dark target, or highlights to flat white on a
// light one.
