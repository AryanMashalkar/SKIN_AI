// Twelve-tone seasonal colour analysis.
//
// This implements the dominance model used by trained personal-colour analysts
// (the Sci\ART / 12-tone lineage), rather than a lookup on skin alone.
//
// The system rests on three independent perceptual axes:
//
//   hue     warm  <-> cool     (undertone)
//   value   light <-> deep     (overall lightness)
//   chroma  bright <-> soft    (clarity / saturation, incl. feature contrast)
//
// A person's season is named for their *dominant* axis — the one on which they
// sit furthest from neutral — with the next-strongest axis breaking the tie:
//
//   dominant VALUE  + light  -> Light Spring (warm)  / Light Summer (cool)
//   dominant VALUE  + deep   -> Deep Autumn (warm)   / Deep Winter (cool)
//   dominant CHROMA + bright -> Bright Spring (warm) / Bright Winter (cool)
//   dominant CHROMA + soft   -> Soft Autumn (warm)   / Soft Summer (cool)
//   dominant HUE    + warm   -> True Spring (light)  / True Autumn (deep)
//   dominant HUE    + cool   -> True Summer (light)  / True Winter (deep)
//
// Crucially, value and chroma cannot be read from skin alone: hair drives
// perceived value more than skin does, and "bright" seasons are defined by high
// *contrast between* features, which is undefined with only one feature. When
// hair and eye colour are missing we say so and lower the reported confidence
// rather than inventing a precise answer.
